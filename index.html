    As a <strong>Project QAQC Manager</strong>, I oversee and coordinate the Employer QA/QC team activities to implement QMS requirements during the project execution of HIDC and GHE projects. I review contractors' Project Quality Plans and monitor and report their quality management performance.

I have demonstrated experience in establishing project quality systems that meet the requirements of ISO 9001 and other international and Saudi Aramco standards. I hold CSWIP 3.1 Welding Inspector and CQI-IRCA ISO 9001:2015 Lead Auditor certifications,
