    With over 20 years of experience in quality management for the oil/gas, power plant, and infrastructure industry, 
    I am a Project QAQC Manager at NEOM Green Hydrogen Company, a visionary project that aims to produce the world's 
    largest green hydrogen facility. 
    <hr />
    As a <strong>Project QAQC Manager</strong>, I oversee and coordinate the Employer QA/QC team activities to implement QMS 
    requirements during the project execution of HIDC and GHE projects. I review contractors' Project Quality Plans and monitor 
    and report their quality management performance. I also audit and support all Contractor Quality Programmes and ensure continuous 
    improvement to the plan as appropriate. I have demonstrated experience in establishing project quality systems that meet the 
    requirements of ISO 9001 and other international and Saudi Aramco standards. I hold CSWIP 3.1 Welding Inspector and CQI-IRCA
